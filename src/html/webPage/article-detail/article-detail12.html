        <p>
            Eyes and memories deceived by the big box’s illusion you can see through the showcase. The space and the imagination are not what they seem. That’s the provocation of the Chinese artist Yan Lei
        </p>

        <p>
            Those who keep track of the passing of works and artists in the tiny roman gallery, as well as the passer aware of what happens in Vicolo del Cinque, experiences a feeling of confusion and of surprise at a first glance. There’s something strange, something not clear beyond the window. The little room appears bigger, but it can’t be true because walls are impossible to move. Bruna Esposito’s work seems still exposed from the previous exhibition. But, another time, it can’t be true because on the door is written Yan Lei. This artist is well known all over the world and he has joined many exhibition even in Italy. Among those the 50th Biennale di Venezia where I has exposed in Zone d’Urgenza. Yan Lei (Hebei,1965; now working in Hong Kong) uses different media, from photography to video, passing through painting, to realize his works. The artist, considered a member of L’Avanguardia Cinese in Italia by A Continuous Dialogue – a Galleria Continua’s exhibition-, has carried out a photographic installation for Edicola Notte.

            So the mistery is disclosed: actually what we see is a big, backlit picture that takes up all the perimeter of the gallery. In fact, the image presents again the neon writing Compro Oro by Bruna Esposito that was exposed at Edicola Notte before; the picture seems placed at the bottom of the space, whereas it is placed basically in its core. It is as Borromini’s columns at Palazzo Spada in Rome or as Bramante’s apse at San Satiro in Milan. The conceived shot creates the illusion of a doubled space rebuilding that one of the previous exhibition. So  a short-circuit starts and the visitor feels charmed and pinned, situated among the texture of cross-references, of spontaneous speculation, of quotations, ready-made and memory. Yan Lei, more as Lupin than as Robin Hood, showing a fruitfully sponging behaviour, steals images, changes their context and reutilises them in a new shape.  These images, that seems accidentally caught during the flowing of daily life, are, instead, moments of Yan’ life and thoughts. The artist has lived these moments and they have left a sign in his memories.
