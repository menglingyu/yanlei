        In order to understand Yan Lei’s work, you must put his art practice in the context of the 30 years of history of Chinese contemporary art. Yan Lei constructs his world of works from a larger point of view, from beginning to end, the art has always been revolved around the system itself, revolving around the artist and this system and between them establishing various complex relationships. These relationships make up the core of Yan Lei’s work. Yan Lei is identified by others as an “agitator”, while actually this is a great misunderstanding. In fact, Yan Lei has always held an honest attitude. As he probes how the vulnerable art system is established on a virtual basis, at the same time, he is also soaked in it and hasfortunately received a kind of “privilege” from the art circle.      </p>

        The exhibition “Extra” will still be shown through the method of painting. Yan Lei himself insists on selecting images with a certain type of intrinsic structure, for example: Goya in Madrid, the trading of the U.S dollar, a collection of skulls, taking in the scenery of Nice while traveling, etc. This is simply just a “name” game, related to what Bourdieu called “arbitrary necessity”. That is, this behavior is still utilized in the art world’s reputation and belief system, highlighting not only the art system’s and practice’s irrational confrontation, but also the tension between the collusive relationships. In addition, the name “Extra” was inspired by one of China Mobile’s services. It will provide you with a short phrase of knowledge before each SMS is sent out. This brings us to understand how those Wikipedia phrases that have no logic relationship with the works “reasonably” appear on every picture.
