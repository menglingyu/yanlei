            Super-light – Yan Lei’s Art Practice
            <p>Ai Weiei</p>
        </h2>
        <p>Yan Lei has started on a new painting series since 2002. Judging from the very first work of this series, we could sense that this was the beginning of an inexhaustible subject in the same way as a drop of salty liquid is in relation to the sea. Yan Lei’s work continually explores and recounts the artist’s interpretation of the ultimate relationship among culture, the act of painting and expression.</p>

        <p>The technique and direction of this type of work have risen from the artist’s realization and understanding, when it comes to painting, as a two-dimensional medium of expression, of the unswerving relationship between the meaning of expression and its form, the indispensability of expression itself, its superficial nature, the relevance, characteristic and the finest state of the motivation for such expression, as well as the consistency between the artist’s world view as expressed and his life style. Such awareness has effortlessly lifted the artist from his personal experience in a narrow sense and the narcissistic complex usually born out of expression.</p>

        <p>The professionalism of the means of expression is exemplified in the author’s command over his self-expression of its meaning and the completeness of his expression. While looking for a valid style, Yan Lei has realized the revolutionary significance that the standardization of artistic expression could offer to painting. This signification is embodied in a completely impersonal and detached approach based on the adoption of a technique. At this particular moment, painting is more than a possibility for individual expression, but more of a graphic, rational and programmed means of production. Its completeness, its degree of sharing and its universal applicability make it perfect and flawless. Painting is no longer painting itself, and instead a rationale for manufacturing and a system that makes it easy to produce and prevail.</p>

        <p>Yan Lei’s day-to-day practice and his struggle on this level can be compared to walking on a deserted street in a busy section of town and it’s often the case.</p>

        <p>On the issues of why to express all along and the impossibility of expression, the content and style of Yan Lei’s work are a manifestation of his view of the world, as if the view of a fly can see must be different from that of ours. Using photographs and pictures, collecting and selecting materials, processing images on computer, printing, prescribing standard color samples, hand sketching, drinking, chatting, checking out apartments, buying cars, making proposals, installing shows, and selling works, while doing all of these, he’s equipped with the precision and composure of a soldier who polishes every component of his rifle on a daily basis. Despite that we live in peacetime and a thriving world, wars are always being fought in someone else’s territory. He also has the impulsive and anxious temperament typical of a Wall Street stock market dealer, the market and opportunities forever rendering reckless changes of mood.</p>

        <p>The precise and strict control over the means of expression is based on the trust in a system and the application of a production system. Through this application, the expression separates meaning from emotion, content from technique, artwork from its author. The motive for disconnecting the artist, the medium, and the subject matter clearly indicates the artist’s sober and wise perception of the relationship among what’s happening outside of him and the people, the matters, the events, the scenarios, and the world that he’s related to.</p>

        <p>The reason that I consider Yan Lei’s work as art when facing it is that if this thing in front of me were not a piece of artwork, then it would be nothing at all. He applies paint, either in black and white, or in color, or in half and half onto canvases, which are never stretched over frames in his studio. This step is considered totally unnecessary by the artist and his paintings have been rolled up naturally when being transported.</p>

        <p>The image that could possibly appear on this painting could be any image. What I mean by any is that you can’t possibly find an image whose content is not suitable to be used as the material for his painting, even though the artist himself doesn’t agree sometimes, “I must choose what I want.” But the artist can’t define what “I” refers to or clarify whether it’s only an expression with a subject. These images include the circus-like curatorial members of the Documenta, the tender and loving daughter of his neighbor, the crass portraits of the art workers who paint for Yan Lei, the Chinese Zodiac with the absence of dragon, the artist’s distrust in the ancient Chinese depiction of dragon, a grand banquet, his school, the wings of an aircraft in the sky above the Mountain Alps, an unrecognizable street, works of other artists of random choices, bad photographs, all that we are familiar with, the seemingly important and foreign and non-specific existence, golden Buddha statues, white-powdered faces, something abstract, something visual and so on. Along this line, whatever exists in the world could become the content of Yan Lei’s paintings or will appear in his paintings. In Yan Lei’s scope of art practice, there is no focal point, axes, or the right to which one must cling to, or tangled emotion. There is only the sequence of appearance and disappearance, the fortuity and necessity of encounters. This attempt to remove himself entirely is the fundamental cause of trouble for Yan Lei.</p>

        <p>The torture of the world and desires has turned him into someone from the “old society.” He is sophisticated while innocent, self-sufficient while full of fantasy, paranoiac while not absurd. Being in tuned with regional fashions as well as having an international spirit, having both shallow pain and a profound sense of satisfaction, having the fear of love and the longing for ties of friendship have made up the humanity of our times.</p>

        <p>In the face of the world, Yan Lei has opted for a valid approach, an appropriate possibility, an inexhaustible story without beginning or end, a story that can be told, or is of no use having been told, or can be left out. Nevertheless, the listener always picks up what the teller hasn’t intended to express.</p>
