            SUPPORT : Yan Lei
            <p>David Ho Yeung Chan</p>
        </h2>
        <p>SUPPORT is an installation/painting project created by Beijing based artist, Yan Lei, who questions our reliance on luxurious settings to endow values in the presentation of contemporary art. In coming to terms with the historical connotations of Three on the Bund [TOTB] a building in Shanghai where this exhibition was held, Yan critiques the commoditization of art with a sense of humor and in turn questions the very meaning of cultural production.</p>

        <p>The word Bund originates from the Persian word ‘band’, meaning an embanked quay or a muddy embankment. The term was first brought to India by the Mughals at the beginning of the 16th century and later, by a member of the Sassoon family, a Baghdadi Jew, to Shanghai in the late 19th century. Once a British settlement immersed within the history of concession, the building boom during the late 19th century brought numerous banks and trading houses to this area and gradually transformed the Bund into a financial center of the Far East.</p>

        <p>The establishment of TOTB, reputed as the leader for defining luxury lifestyle in Shanghai, has transformed the Bund’s outlook from a past international settlement steeped within colonial history to that of a location increasingly crowded with high brow culinary and retail outlets. The building was built in 1916 by the Union Assurance Company; its past occupants included the East Asiatic and Mercantile Bank of India. In 2000, the American architect Michael Graves was commissioned to redesign the interior of Bund number three in the hopes of capturing the very imagination of an emerging class of urban socialites- Shanghai style. The center piece of Graves’ design focuses on reinterpreting the east and west atrium in a neo-classical manner. The east atrium situated inside the gallery incorporates a series of wooden pillars in combination with a green marble façade to stage a dramatic towering enclave; the interplay of light and shadow, resembling a forest, is intended to evoke naturalism in a laden building which also sets the tone for the gallery’s interior.</p>

        <p>With the opening of the SGA in January of 2004, every attempt has been made to enrich this site with a sense of history and to make it a credible place in the presentation of contemporary art. Unlike the white cube gallery model which predicates on the viewing of art as a pure and neutral experience, what this gallery offers is much more- a historic building, panoramic views of Pudong and the Bund, a remarkable atrium¬ all there to enrich an inherent meaning of the artwork on display. While many artists are deeply impressed by such prominent architectural features which define the gallery space, only a handful of artists proactively reflect upon their practice in relation to the institutional identity let alone its physical conditions for validating the artwork on view.</p>

        <p>Yan Lei poses the question of what we may add to such a laden platform. As the building’s colonial past is featured to legitimate its commercial activities, yet there remains a void in locating its real place. What is the inherent meaning for showcasing contemporary art in such a gentrified setting? Furthermore, given that the presentation of contemporary art in the gallery falls prey to the master narrative of a luxurious environment, what is the symbiotic relationship between a regime of self-aggrandizement and an endorsement of the cultural capital of art itself? What are the other possibilities for artistic intervention at a site which has set out to validate art in the first place?</p>

        <p>As one enters the gallery, one first observes a series of twelve large scale classical pillars; similar samples are easily found from amongst the many buildings along the Bund. In knowing that the existing pillars are in effect permanent structure which dictates the reading of artwork in the space, Yan enlarges these pillars in a direct scale to those Doric columns that are currently located at the gallery’s foyer, as a way to negotiate with its physical presence. Intended to re-historicize the site, the artist has chosen to use the mud from the Whampoa River as the “local” yet fragile material for making these artificial pillars look aged. An additional support structure is therefore provided for the gallery, but it appears if nothing has really occurred after all.</p>

        <p>To soften the tone of an all-out institutional critique on the gallery, Yan has decided to include a series of color wheel paintings for this exhibition. Five large scale "target" paintings have been installed on the farthest possible viewing space from the gallery’s entrance, and with one edge of the paintings fledged with those of the encompassing walls. The reasoning behind placing such paintings beyond immediate normal sight is done almost by one of chances, there to satisfy our expectation to see an artwork in the most compromised manner possible in an art gallery. Made by trained workers and completed with a numeric formula in mind (as specified by the artist), the color of the focal center of one panel inside a painting reflects as the background of what follows. One may associate these paintings with the inner quality of the muddy pillars in full sight, yet the former and latter have no direct link with one another whatsoever. Should the quality of an exhibition be judged by delivering a coherent message to the public, Yan is interested in provoking a sense of unease, one that polarizes the tension between the painting’s abstract visual effects versus the imposition of an architectural order of a given space towards the extreme.</p>

        <p>Support not only functions as a footnote to reveal the innate architectural program by making it more apparent to the audience, it invites us to contemplate the absurdity of a celebrated site, whereby displaced architectural fragments, a sole wall of a white cube space, a monolithic atrium, reconstituted remnants of a historic building- all disparate components- come together to form a blasé platform that demands a constant presence of artwork to validate itself.</p>

        <p>During a recent interview, Yan Lei stated: "The system of working is the extension of my knowledge in the art of creating images, including the application of what I understand about light, composition, color and the system of making. What is interesting is that people sometimes dont think I have done anything at all, or, that there is any trace of concept in it. It is good that they dont really realize how passionate I am about these things. An artwork is like a seed. After you throw it, you dont have any control over it."  As a critical protagonist who probes the blanketing effect of a burgeoning contemporary Chinese art market, Yan pokes fun at the actual apparatus of the business of marketing cultural differences and teases out how different ways value and meaning are attached to cultural production. Yan transcends what is given into something unpredictable that denies a common logic. Now you have the seed….</p>
