      <h2>
        Yan Lei－deep breath
        <p>Andrew Maerkle</p>
      </h2>
      <p>
        With his signature tinted aviators, floppy black hair and leather jacket, 43-year-old Yan Lei was in his element at Decembers Art Basel Miami Beach, primed for the crucible of bright lights, celebrity and sales that comprise the annual sun-splashed bacchanal. Striding through the hallways of the Miami Beach Convention Center, the Chinese artist exchanged a boisterous hug with Belgian provocateur and part-time Beijing resident Wim Delvoye, known for his farm of tattooed pigs, as visitors milled around them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yan Lei appeared unfazed that his original paintings intended for Galleria Continua’s presentation in the fair’s Art Kabinett section had been held up by US Customs; a gallery assistant hand-carried replacements on a last-minute flight from Pairs, where Yan’s works were part of a group show inaugurating a new Continua branch, Le Moulin, outside the city. Few people, if anyone, noticed anything amiss. The hasty installation of the surrogate paintings behind burlesque red-and-white striped curtains inadvertently embodied the “show must go on” mentality that drives major art events.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few days later in wintry New York, Yan was more subdued, as he checked on his solo show at Robert Miller Gallery, “Sparkling,” which opened in late November. If the circus of Art Basel hadn’t exhausted him, the it was the cumulative effects of a year that included participation in the prestigious German mega-exhibition documeta12 the Istanbul Biennial. Just a decade before, Yan first earned notoriety with Invitation (1997), a provocative intervention in which he and fellow artist Hong Hao sent fake invitations from documenta to their Chinese peers, an early warning against the delusions of self-importance. Some recipients, taking it seriously, were incensed to discover they had been hoaxed.
     </p>
     <p>
        The margins have shifted considerably since then. While Chinese artists were once dismissed as “derivative” by US and European institutions, they now move about the highest echelons of the international art hierarchy. Some have settled into the comforts of art stardom. Yet Yan, who speaks admiringly of Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol and Jeff Koons for transforming art into the expression of coy defiance, is still wary of the system, alternately challenging its values and subverting its mechanisms at every turn.
     </p>
     <p>
        Born in Langfang outside Beijing in 1965 and trained as a printmaker at Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts, Yan is among a generation of Chinese artists working across different mediums, from photography and video to performance and installation. In 2000, following a three-year stint in Hong Kong, Yan began to focus on painting. He devised paint-by-numbers system that breaks down images into their components, destabilizing the idea of painting itself and pushing it toward and “artificial realism.” Ever-irreverent, Yan dismisses the canon entirely, referring to painting as “a mindless representation of an image you might see in a photograph.”
     </p>
     <p>
        The apotheosis of this studied devil-may-care attitude is Yan’s “Super Lights” series(2004-05), inspired by low-tar cigarettes, for which he reproduced other artists’ seminal works in large-format canvases. Picasso’s rose period Boy with Pipe became Super Lights-Picasso (2005), a blurry, flattened rendering of the original divided into blue and red sections. Super Lights-Divert Water the Milky Way Down (2005), similarly treats a classic 1973-74 social-realist tableaux of agricultural workers by Sun Guoqi and Zhang Hongzhan. Yan reflects, “Because I was copying other people’s works, my paintings weren’t as strong as the original. I thought of the cigarette filter as a metaphor for removing creative energy.”
     </p>
     <p>
        His latest interest, “Sparking,” reflects a boom-time, super-clean aesthetic that could have been lifted from a box of laundry detergent. Radiating metallic-hued bands of color serve as the series’ informal motif, through which Yan Glamorizes an incongruous range of subjects, from a smiling Jeff Koons to documenta12’s husband-and-wife curatorial team Roger Buergel and Ruth Noack, as well as rows of stewardesses lifted from kitsch 1950s and 1960s airline promotional material.
     </p>
     <p>
        Now lauded by the establishment, Yan turns the rules of a once exclusionary system inside out by exposing the faults in its logic; values, like great works of art, change over time and they can be broken down and reassembled. At present, value is dictated by the market, which Yan approaches with a bracing pragmatism: “The art scene has changed. Increasingly, market forces are greater than the strength of any individual artist’s willpower. All you can do is to be clear about the situation.” He continues extemporizing, “Curators seem to share one problem: they are ever more polarized from the commercial sphere.  Artists that curators don’t like are selling for higher and higher prices. And when your work is that expensive, you can ignore the curators!”
     </p>
     <p>
        While this sounds self-contradictory, Yan relishes the idea that he can get away with anything. Commissioned to make a work for the exhibition “Fifth System” in Shenzhen in late 2003, sponsored by the real-estate development firm CHINAOCT, Yan roped off a plot of prime land and stipulated that it could not be touched for two years. At Beijing’s Taikang Top Space Contemporary Art Center in 2006, Yan reunited with Hong Hao, spending their CNY 7 million (USD 1 million) production budget to buy life insurance for themselves form the center’s financial backer, Taikang Life Insurance.
     </p>
     <p>
        For the 2007 Istanbul Biennial, he brought the Beijing punk band Brain Failure with him to Turkey, where they staged a live set at the Istanbul nightclub Dogzstar. Yan recorded the performance and presented it in the exhibition as video and installation of posters and ephemera. Yan recalls diffidently, “I thought it was a fun thing to do. When we finished the project, Istanbul director Hou Hanru and all curators were excited, they thought it was great.”
     </p>
     <p>
        A more conventional exhibition at Aspen Art Museum, which opened in February, consists of suite of nine paintings from the “Sparking” series installed as one narrative reflecting Yan’s global, whirlwind itinerary, with stewardesses abutting a glowing mountain peak and Any Warhol huddling in a fur-trimmed parka. Aspen Art Museum director and chief curator Heidi Zuckerman Jacobson rejects the notion that Aspen, famed as an exclusive ski resort, is a prime target for Yan’s pointed satire reasoning, “If he’s commenting on Aspen at all I would say the radiating band motif is indicative of the magnetism that draws people here.”
     </p>
     <p>
        Whether or not Yan appreciated Aspen’s seclusion, he remains hard to pin down conceptually and geographically. While visiting Huo Hanru in San Francisco on his way to Aspen, he phoned ArtAsiaPacific to plug the Aspen show and mentioned his plans to travel to Rome for another museum gig. An itinerant art world impresario, Yan Lei embodies the airy optimism of his works’ titles: “Super Light” and “Sparking,” he addresses a world unmoored from its own reality.
