            What I like to do
            <p>
                Interviewer: Li Zhenhua | Interviewee: Yan Lei | There’s Documenta on Earth
            </p>
        </h2>
        <p>Li Zhenhua (LZH): Since your project Invitation Letter from 1997, on which you worked together with Hong Hao, Documenta has been at the core of your creations. Of course, 1997 coincided with the tenth edition of Documenta and you cleverly seized this opportunity that only comes around once every five years, and turned it into a work that connected this international art event with the local contemporary art sphere. Exactly 15 years have passed since then, and you are now participating for a second time in Documenta. How do you look at your earlier works like Invitation Letter, From Here to Kassel (1998), and the Sparkling: Aspen series (2006) as well as the Landing series (2007)? What do you think about the connections and clues between these works?</p>
        <p>Yan Lei (YL): Artists all consider participation in Documenta to be the most glorious event. Back in 1997 Documenta felt like something very distant from myself, therefore, when I thought about the issue of art, I felt rather lonely and powerless. None of the steps forward I made in my work were predictable, yet there was one difficulty and question that I was confronted with as an artist, that never left my head.</p>
        <p>LZH: What was it that troubled you? What were you confronted with? This might be a question that changes over the course of time. This difficulty, did it fade away? Or did it rather grow bigger?</p>
        <p>YL: What troubled me was that there was no way to communicate between people, so I could only face loneliness. I find myself often alone in front of a white canvas and I don’t know how to start. I don’t know what I should do tomorrow.</p>
        <p>LZH: Are financial constraints troubling you?</p>
        <p>YL: I believe that the more money one has, the more freedom one gets. But the question of how to find an outlet through art cannot be solved with money.</p>
        <p>LZH: Your answer reminds me of contemporary art’s present course. Since its emergence, the most outstanding phenomena in contemporary culture’s transformation, is the artist’s never-ending metamorphosis. I am very interested in who you think an artwork is created; and also, where the artist stands today?</p>
        <p>YL: A work is of course made for oneself and for the people interested in one’s work. To obtain more freedom, you have to disregard whether you are an artist or not.</p>
        <p>Migration is the way to discover</p>
        <p>LZH: In 1997 you must have already moved to Hong Kong. During your time there, you created mula dito papuntiang Kassel (This way to Kassel 这里通往卡塞尔) (1998), Red Light District (1998) and Second Hand Shop (1999). Apparently, mula dito papuntiang Kassel (This way to Kassel 这里通往卡塞尔) is like a transition between Kassel and your life’s environment; and Second Hand Shop leads your work again to the misleading margins of contemporary art. Your relocation from Beijing to Hong Kong caused a fundamental change in your creations, which is to say, you started to become aware of the differences between the living and cultural contexts, and began very soon to catch up with Hong Kong’s cultural vein, and information from the bordering globalized contemporary art world. How do you see this transformation, from the changes in your identity to the shifting of your art’s inclination, from distant to close – corresponding to the changes in the issues with Documenta, to Red Light District and Second Hand Shop?</p>
        <p>YL: Confronted with the despair caused by loneliness, how can the path of art be continued? At that time, I wanted to adjust the state I was in, and examine my identity, so I made those works. Second Hand Shop (also named Hallelujah) was using art’s name to relieve my own burdens and to loosen my restraints, a way to manage my state of mind. Hong Kong’s art sphere is very enthusiastic about political games. Nobody can go beyond these kind of rules. I felt rather incompetent doing art there.</p>
        <p>LZH: You left China’s cultural and political situation and fell into Hong Kong’s cultural and political labyrinth. If you compare the cultural and political states back then, what are the differences between China and Hong Kong? What kind of state and identity did you need to keep going, as an artist in that kind of transition?</p>
        <p>YL: Mainland China is very big and Hong Kong is very small. Hong Kong is cleaner than Beijing. You only need to know where you can live naturally, that is the best state.</p>
        <p>LZH: Where do you see the connection between creation and environment? If we can predict the formal changes in your art by looking at the previous transitions in your creations, there seems to be a certain relation to your continued relocations, like the pessimism you have mentioned caused by learning about the life and art circle in Hong Kong. Did that come from the desolation that you felt after removing your burdens, or rather through the disappointment with the art system? Also, were your frequent journeys to France related to all that? The changes in your creations, were they connected to your periods of emigration to France?</p>
        <p>YL: My concepts of time and space were basically completely formed in mainland China. I used to want to go abroad, but when that finally happened, I couldn’t find any sense beyond the language, due to its barrier. What is important to me now, is to find a place with living habits that suit me the best. If you cannot get accustomed to a place’s conventions, then you will not be able to consider questions of art. This is the connection between me, my creations, and the environment.</p>
        <p>LZH: The question discussed above can be seen as the direction and transformation of your creations before 2000, which is also when the main subjects started to appear in your work. This was somehow different than your earlier video and photography works that dealt with injuries to one’s own body. What drew your attention and interest to a kind of center of culture? How did you let go of this issue that was emphasized for a certain period after your arrival in Hong Kong?</p>
        <p>YL: I think, an artist’s motivation to create is mainly to free him from his inner loneliness. Thus, the means and methods are not the most important. What matters is that the artist himself has to feel a stimulus. Fresh out of school, I really hoped that my identity as an artist would be recognized. Later, I felt indifferent about that.</p>
        <p>LZH: If the media’s transformation doesn’t matter to you, where do the stimuli come from? What causes their emergence? Your creations convey a special kind of calmness and sense of isolation, are the stimuli you are talking about rational or emotional ones? And in terms of media, you finally chose painting as the medium in which to express yourself, there must be also a reason for that…</p>
        <p>YL: The stimulus I was talking about is derived from having autonomous control over one’s work, and being able to precisely accomplish one’s goals, it is a stimulus that comes with power. Every work is like a theatre play in my head. I imagine it as a stage, and when all the questions are gathered, it will be one of those statements, transmitted by artistic figures at all times.</p>
        <p>LZH: Here you emphasize the statements conveyed by the body, but in your works, you try to participate as little as possible, how do you explain this contradiction? An artist’s presence or absence, how is that decided? The body that you focused on, is it the specific “body of work” referred to in art, or do you mean your own body’s presence?</p>
        <p>YL: What I am trying to say is, that an artist’s exterior is indeed a psychological manifestation. My attitude towards work is to minimize my participation in the work’s production.</p>
        <p>LZH: What you said about art history, work concepts and their understanding, I can deeply relate to. The current interpretative systems and cultural criticisms, as well as cultural studies, can hardly meet the requirements of advanced contemporary art; the conceptions of historical studies often only allow us to look backwards and consider merely the question of the origin of today’s art. Even so, we are still confronted with a growing amount of strain in the course of contemporary art, which is caused by considering (interdisciplinary) knowledge, geo-cultural contextual relations and bodily experiences as obstacles that are moving and colliding in between the realms of aesthetics and others. Of course there is still the area of psychology that you mentioned. Hence, how is the artist’s image (that you point out), related to his work here?</p>
        <p>YL: I believe that art exists beyond a work’s language (of object or presentation). Therefore, the less I (the artist) make or intervene, the purer the art; the artist’s existence is only to provide some spiritual illusions for those “objects” that are presenting the work.</p>
        <p>Art, The Fifth Element, UAP (Unlimited Art Project), and A Present from Beijing</p>
        <p>LZH: After 1998, your work seemed to become even more inclined towards painting. Within the outstanding projects at that time painting was, besides a concept, always present – International Yeast (2004), the Centre Pompidou project (2002–2003), the Nice project (2004), and The Fifth Element (2004). How do you think painting is related to your concepts? Why can’t it be replaced by another medium, or be completely erased? I have noticed that your projects from 2004 were increasingly based on invitations by and residencies within the museum system. How do you perceive the effect of this integration into the art system, and are your creations following a particular standard or type? The Fifth Element can be viewed as a form of attention towards the rise of land ownership. Does this work, which is detached from the museum system, contain some differences in its conceptual approach?</p>
        <p>YL: Painting has always been on my mind. I devoted myself a lot to it and gained a lot of experience in return. Painting is sometimes an opportunity to express one’s attitude towards art. If I paint some images related to my own experience, even without the content and reasoning (logic) of traditional painting, how can that not become art today?!</p>
        <p>LZH: Indeed, what has not turned into art today? I want to return to the starting point of the contemporary, which is also how we consider the field of art in the context of contemporary existentialism. Of course, this question can also be applied to what is not the political or the economy today. So, what do you think would be the result, if politics, economy and art interchanged? What would art be? Would it be an environmental issue? Or rights protection? Or rather something else?</p>
        <p>YL: Why can’t we exchange “art” for “what I like to do”?</p>
        <p>LZH: Real estate and the economy, these factors from art’s exterior, were also drawn into the creation process of The Fifth Element, as well as the question of how politics manifests itself within the economy. This project was transformed into a painting (or a parallel between concept and painting). How do you see their relation? Usually a project is documented through photos or videos, painting is the oldest method to record events. Do you see painting as a mere tool of documentation? And the order in this work, of project, photography and painting: how are they related?</p>
        <p>YL: I often use archive material as a resource for my paintings. Any material in the form of a photo can be used, many photos have become my paintings’ content. At the same time, due to this method, my participation in the paintings’ production has been reduced.</p>
        <p>LZH: Today, any event or object can be art. Hence, what is the core of art creation for you? Here, we don’t have to talk about what the current art mainstream or the core meaning is, because this would indicate that art is still dependent on the axis of politics and the economy. What I want to know is not how you perceive the world, but how you see your own approach going forward.</p>
        <p>YL: Everybody can say that they make “contemporary art.” As contemporary art has already been commercialized, art has no standards anymore, and neither do I. My motive to make art is just because I like to, I don’t think more reasons are necessary, but whether this kind of sentiment will change, I cannot guarantee…</p>
        <p>LZH: Recently, your installation for the Edicola Notte Gallery in Rome in 2007 was talked about a lot, and also your work for the Gwangju Biennale (Appetizer). Can you tell us more about these two works? The Gwangju piece must have appeared during the time of your UAP painting project. How is the Rome project related to Documenta and A Present from Beijing?</p>
        <p>YL: In 2002 I participated in the Sao Paolo, Shanghai and also the Gwangju Biennales. Working a whole year for Biennales, it felt like a drug addiction! For that reason I created the work called Appetizer for Gwangju. I like Rome’s Edicola Notte Gallery, because the space is extremely small, so small that whatever you do, feels like too much, there, I tried to keep doing nothing at all.</p>
        <p>In 2001, after an exhibition at the CAAW (China Art Archives & Warehouse), I began to have some money on that account. I thought I could officially establish my own production line in the form of UAP.</p>
        <p>LZH: In 2002 you participated in many Biennales, did that create a more international perspective for you and you started to reflect about the origins of this cultural relation? Did that trigger the initiation of UAP?</p>
        <p>YL: The UAP exists within the market. Its desire for freedom and infinity coexists with the paradox of the market’s limitedness.</p>
        <p>LZH: In addition to accepting Documenta’s invitation in 2007, you also created A Present from Beijing (2007). Was the Kassel project a rapprochement or challenge to the art system and power? Where do you see the connection between A Present from Beijing and the Documenta project in terms of the creation of the art system’s characteristics?</p>
        <p>YL: At Documenta in 2007, my older works were shown. During the exhibition period, my participation was rather insignificant. At the same time, on the invitation of the Istanbul Biennale, I brought Beijing’s punk rock band Brain Failure with me for a concert (party) as my contribution to the exhibition. It was completely absorbed by that city – that is the ideal state of art (creation).</p>
        <p>LZH: Can you talk about the exhibits from 2007, and the real circumstances of the exhibition? What was the reason that the curator chose to display your older works? The last Documenta was rather controversial, mostly because of the money and pressure on and manipulation of Documenta by the gallery industry. What was the reality that you experienced and saw there? Did this experience determine your approach for Istanbul? Or was it rather because your older works were exhibited, so you had more time to prepare the project for Istanbul? What did Hou Hanru (who curated the Istanbul Biennale) think about this work, and what was the reason that it was finally accepted?</p>
        <p>YL: I am not sure about what every curator thinks, but I know that Hou Hanru really respects artists’ ideas. At the same time, his demands towards art’s “purity” are very high. He responded (and agreed) to my concept very quickly. We all felt that A Present from Beijing surpassed the existing museum and gallery market system’s understanding of art.</p>
        <p>LZH: Here you had a museum or gallery system as a reference, by understanding this issue, especially in the moment when A Present from Beijing was accepted by the existing contemporary art system. Does that prove this system’s openness and tolerance? Of course, this is a different issue from the one of presentation. The “artwork-zation” caused by the limits of presentation and expectations towards art, was completely dissolved (or reconstructed) by A Present from Beijing.</p>
        <p>YL: In my eyes, this is not openness, but the question of contemporary art’s values.</p>
        <p>LZH: How does the ideal situation that you mentioned look like? Where do the things exist that you see as your work? Is it in your actions or in Brain Failure’s performance? How is your art achieved? As in this work, no specific art was used as an “object” that was presented visually, and there was also no reliance on studies of art space (museum), one can say it was completely empty from the beginning to the end.</p>
        <p>YL: In my opinion, the highest form of art is that which cannot be represented by an object that exists beyond words. Thus I consider an artist’s overall approach towards his work as art. I see it as the artist’s interpretation of art.</p>
        <p>LZH: Your concept of the overall approach is wonderful, this must be already your art, or is it a response to contemporary art’s existing concepts?</p>
        <p>YL: Contemporary art is just like a stone. So it can be only dealt with according to one’s own understanding.</p>
