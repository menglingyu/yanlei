        <h2>
            Is there anything that cannot become art?
            <p>
                Lu Yinghua=LYH | Yan Lei=YL
            </p>
        </h2>
        <p>LYH: It seems that your work can be divided into two themes, one of them employs painting as a creative medium; from early on, you used color blocks to dissect existing images and copied them mechanically onto the canvas, until the Color Wheel series and then the recent Sparkling series, which is also based on ready-made images and fixed patterns. Please tell us about your views on painting with respect to these three stages as examples, and your opinion about repetition and mass production of art.</p>
        <p>YL: About painting, this kind of medium is made for collecting, therefore I regard it directly as a product. Famous paintings are famous because they comply with the rules of the market and capital operations.</p>
        <p>My studio can produce paintings according to my ideas; I will try my best to do as many different works as possible under the existing conditions. Paintings I have done in this way are for instance Climbing Space, Super Lights or Sparkling, they were all landscape or figure images conceived by me. Climbing Space is something connected to my identity; the image for Super Lights came from artists or works that influenced me; Sparkling is related to my memory.</p>
        <p>The abstract paintings were produced through the special conditions in my studio, I hope that my abstract works can show a form of automaticity. For example Color Wheel is like a studio parasite, it has indefinite possibilities to reproduce itself.</p>
        <p>Mass production is my ideal working method, it doesn’t only often put me into a state of excitement, but also triggers discussions about art, artists, works and value, which is what I am interested in.</p>
        <p>LYH: Through that three-staged work process, you as the artist create a certain mode of style and production and transfers this procedure afterwards to the workers, you even made the effort to design a production flow to eliminate, as far as possible, a paintings special characteristics and individuality, so that somebody who cannot paint can also do the painting for you. Was this mode of creation aimed at art history? Or what was it aimed at?</p>
        <p>YL: In order not to touch the canvas, I really spent a lot of work and effort to be at service for my painting assistants, because painting could not prove my pure and unique pursuit of art. At the same time, with regard to painting, I was more like somebody providing goods to the market, I hoped to do things more accurately, I think that the accuracy behind a work is more important than to determine if it was done by the artist – this is also my attitude towards art.</p>
        <p>LYH: Can you please be a bit specific about the concept behind Sparkling, how did you start to create this series?</p>
        <p>YL: Sparkling was a painting theme that I started to think about last year, mostly because of some images that had arisen from memory, I like how the light is exaggerated, so that the image appears to be both a glorification and a travesty.</p>
        <p>LYH: The other important thread created by you, covers multi-media, and even multiple disciplines. Your work outside of painting seems to happen in all kinds of public spaces. For example, your work during the 2004 Shenzhen Biennale, where you struggled with local real estate developers to maintain the state of a large area of land to be undeveloped for two years (The Fifth Element), to the recent Down Town Production project, where you invited the band Brain Failure to perform at various important art events. Please tell us about the importance of this thread within your artistic practice. How did you move towards creations in that direction?</p>
        <p>…</p>
        <p>YL: To cooperate with Brain Failure was really an exciting idea, I took advantage of the conditions provided by an exhibition opportunity and the name of art, to invite my friends to go abroad. Which is to say I moved a fragment of my life there. The excitement created by Brain Failures performance, also turned into a part of the citys urban experience. Everything that happened there, including the discussions that arose to judge its status as art, all that is art for me. Anyway I dont care about the difference between an artist and an ordinary person – a lot of things made by people who call themselves artists are not even as good as garbage.</p>
        <p>LYH: How do you interpret the artists ability and power to “call a stag a horse” [deliberately misrepresent] in regard to your cooperation with Brain Failure?</p>
        <p>YL: My connection with Brain Failure is a part of my life. What I provide to other people is my life experience. An artists power and ability also depend on a curators understanding and interest.</p>
        <p>LYH: An artists will has always been subject to the artists own constant new understandings and definitions. How strong do you think is an artists will?</p>
        <p>YL: You can use all kinds of wisdoms to explain art, but contemporary art cannot reflect an artists real willpower.</p>
        <p>LYH: What is your opinion on Andy Warhol and his art empire? Do you think it still makes sense to continue his ideas and creations today? Or rather, in China, on this particular soil, what kind of reference and inspiration can Andy Warhols art practice give us?</p>
        <p>YL: Every artist envies Andy Warhol, for his works remind me of how to express my desires.</p>
        <p>LYH: You have also virtualized a young artist and did all kinds of marketing and publicity for her, is this also a work of yours? What is the concept behind that? What is the difference between you, as an artist, and the virtual her?</p>
        <p>YL: I have a friend, she likes to think about art through a virtual identity.</p>
