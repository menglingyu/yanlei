        要了解颜磊的作品，必须将他的艺术实践置于中国当代艺术30年的历史发展的语境中。颜磊所构建的作品世界，从大的方面看，始终围绕着艺术体制本身，围绕着艺术家与这个体制所建立起来的各种复杂的关系，这些关系构成了颜磊作品的核心。有意思的是，颜磊被人视为“寻衅者”的身份其实是一种对他的极大的误解。事实上，颜磊始终抱以一种诚实的态度，在试探这个脆弱的艺术体制是如何建立在虚拟的基础之上的同时，他本人也深陷其中并幸运地获得了艺术界所馈赠的“特权”。

          In order to understand Yan Lei’s work, you must put his art practice in the context of the 30 years of history of Chinese contemporary art. Yan Lei constructs his world of works from a larger point of view, from beginning to end, the art has always been revolved around the system itself, revolving around the artist and this system and between them establishing various complex relationships. These relationships make up the core of Yan Lei’s work. Yan Lei is identified by others as an “agitator”, while actually this is a great misunderstanding. In fact, Yan Lei has always held an honest attitude. As he probes how the vulnerable art system is established on a virtual basis, at the same time, he is also soaked in it and hasfortunately received a kind of “privilege” from the art circle.

        Some Transitions Experienced by an Artist
        <p>Li zhenhua</p>
      </h2>
      <p>
        Following the Stars Group and the Anonymous Painting
Group Movements at the end of the 1970s, the early
period of China’s contemporary art started to recover
a spirit of individuality, after being used as a political
mouthpiece, as the popularization of cultural unification,
and as a representative of the “Serve the People”
ideology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cultural phenomena of the 1980s, which sprung up in various places,
clearly formed a temporary trend for the future of China’s contemporary
art. If we compare the end of the seventies to 1985, the most striking
difference is in the way art declared itself: the struggle for freedom
and the need for an independent creative spirit in the 1970s, compared
to the 1980s that acted completely outside of this context – doesn’t
this exactly illustrate the ideological change? The needs for
individualization at the end of the seventies and the diversified
reality of the eighties—whether in direct confrontation or completely
forgotten and dispersed—heralded the end of the revolutionary era.

        With one billion people in China, how does one sort and contextualize
information, identity, and meaning? What should be recorded?
Beijing-based artist Yan Lei utilizes a reductive method of painting in
an effort to unify, translate, and synthesize. His paintings explore the
possibility of authenticity within a culture where the very notion of
individuality is continually in question.

        There is little doubt that Chinese contemporary art is an emerging force in global art.
The presence of Chinese artists at major international art events is
significant, while more and more members of the international art world
are visiting, and acting in, China.1 What is the real impact of Chinese
contemporary art in Chinese society, as well as the larger world, today?
As is well documented through the international media, China is
experiencing an explosive economic, consumptive, and urbanizing boom.
Social democracy and justice are, however, evolving at a slower pace.
Individual freedom, and creativity in particular, has not been
encouraged. Artists are caught in an intense contradiction—a
schizophrenic social context. Thus, contemporary art in China is highly
diverse and complex.

        Negotiating the Non-Negotiable: On the Work of Yan Lei
        <p>Hou Hanru</p>
      </h2>
      <p>
      As a spearhead of globalization, today’s art is intrinsically related to and even conditioned by the system of power, that is in turn defined by institutional and/or market success. Contemporary art, in the meantime, is increasingly being turned into highbrow entertainment, smoothly integrated into the world of celebrity, the vanity fair. It has gained unprecedented popularity, the subject of urban gossip, covered in all media, while pretending to be creative, innovative – even provocative.
      </p>
      <p>
      On the other hand, following the logic of economic globalization, the institutional and market system of contemporary art has largely expanded to reach the non-Western world. China, India, Turkey, Russia, and even the Middle East, not to mention Latin America and Africa, are now the new frontiers of the system’s exploration, with new “centers” being established in those areas. Among them, Chinese artists are certainly the most sought-after species, and Yan Lei has been one of the new stars raised from the Chinese soil in the last decade.

      Those who keep track of the passing of works and artists in the tiny roman gallery, as well as the passer aware of what happens in Vicolo del Cinque, experiences a feeling of confusion and of surprise at a first glance. There’s something strange, something not clear beyond the window. The little room appears bigger, but it can’t be true because walls are impossible to move. Bruna Esposito’s work seems still exposed from the previous exhibition. But, another time, it can’t be true because on the door is written Yan Lei. This artist is well known all over the world and he has joined many exhibition even in Italy. Among those the 50th Biennale di Venezia where I has exposed in Zone d’Urgenza. Yan Lei (Hebei,1965; now working in Hong Kong) uses different media, from photography to video, passing through painting, to realize his works. The artist, considered a member of L’Avanguardia Cinese in Italia by A Continuous Dialogue – a Galleria Continua’s exhibition-, has carried out a photographic installation for Edicola Notte.

      英语中“Bund”一词来自波斯语“band”，意为筑堤码头或裸土堤坝。起初该词在16世纪被莫卧儿人带到印度；到了19世纪末期，一个来自沙宣家族（Sassoon family）的巴格达迪犹太人（Baghdadi Jew）将它带到上海。接着殖民史开始书写，浸满了大英帝国的气味，19世纪晚期“外滩”（the Bund）地区大量银行与商贸行的建筑鳞次栉比，从而逐渐成长为远东的金融中心。

      <p>
        SUPPORT is an installation/painting project created by Beijing based artist, Yan Lei, who questions our reliance on luxurious settings to endow values in the presentation of contemporary art. In coming to terms with the historical connotations of Three on the Bund [TOTB] a building in Shanghai where this exhibition was held, Yan critiques the commoditization of art with a sense of humor and in turn questions the very meaning of cultural production.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word Bund originates from the Persian word ‘band’, meaning an embanked quay or a muddy embankment. The term was first brought to India by the Mughals at the beginning of the 16th century and later, by a member of the Sassoon family, a Baghdadi Jew, to Shanghai in the late 19th century. Once a British settlement immersed within the history of concession, the building boom during the late 19th century brought numerous banks and trading houses to this area and gradually transformed the Bund into a financial center of the Far East.

        “严格地说，我并不属于任何媒介所规定的艺术家。从996年开始我作了一些同当代艺术问题有关的作品，在涉及这个问题的时候，我并没有选择固定的模式和媒介，这同时也是我对传统的表达方式的厌倦和以当代艺术名义标榜的实质却是现代主义品位的质疑所导致。”--颜磊

      从某种意义上讲，颜磊获得2002年中国当代艺术奖的最接触艺术家奖既是一件“黑马事件”，同时也是一件众望所归的事情。而他的获奖不断地提醒着人们他的几件作品。1997年，他和洪浩以IeInay Oahgnlh（他们二人姓名拼音的逆序书写）的名义向全国的艺术界人士发去了卡塞尔文献展的邀请信。无数来自卡塞尔的邀请信一时成为国内美术界所热衷的话题，而这件恶作剧式的作品却也迫使人民在被戏弄之后保持了少有的缄默。他们做的是隐藏这件作品所催生的笑话，作为报复，他们将这封信视作一个恶作剧，而不是一件作品。也许当时人们更习惯在各种学术刊物谈论中国艺术家的命运与国际文化权力，却不习惯处于同样目的的检测出现在身边。2000年当梁洁华基金会邀请了一些著名的国际展览策划人和基金会主席来到中国的上海、广州、杭州、北京、深圳和香港的时候，颜磊又雇佣了一些不明身份的人用单色画法复制了那张国际策划人在中国园林中的著名合影。

      "Strictly speaking, Im not an artist as defined by any medium. Since 1996 I have done some works related to contemporary art issues. I didnt choose a fixed pattern or medium where these issues were involved. That was because I was bored with traditional means of expression and I began to question the essentially modernistic taste that claimed to be contemporary art." --Yan Lei
      </p>
      <p>
      In a certain sense, Yan Leis winning the award of Most Outstanding Artist of the 2002 Contemporary Chinese Art Awards was at once the appearance of a "dark horse" and what everyone had wished. And his winning the award served to remind people of several specific works. In 1997, he and Hong Hao sent members of art circles across China an invitation to the Kassel Documenta Exhibition under the name Ielnay Oahgnoh. This was a combination of his name - and that of Hong Hao - in Pinyin written backward. The countless letters of invitation from Kassel became a hot topic in the fine arts community and having been tricked this hoax made people keep a rare silence. They concealed the joke implied in this work and, as revenge, regarded the letter as a hoax, not a work. Perhaps people were more used to discussing the fate of Chinese artists and international cultural power in various academic periodicals at that time than to experiencing a test for the same purpose.

      颜磊1965年出生于廊坊。父亲是工厂会计，母亲是学校老师。有亲戚都是颇有名气的画家。15岁的时候，他移居到河北保定 ,进入了一所艺术院校。
      </p>
      <p>
      保定毕业后，他花了几年时间，考上杭州的中国美术学院，1987年如愿以偿。“刚进校时，我基本上只是一个学习制作版画者。只是通过图书馆才完全改变了我的视野。突然，我们就找到了途径发现世界上其他地方在发生着什么”。
      </p>
      <p>
        杭州的中国美院，当时是肖峰当院长。对于那些后来被公认为重要艺术家的很多人而言，他都是一个孵化器。颜磊同住一宿舍的是后来的艺术家兼策展人邱志杰，颜磊也帮助他同一个工作室的更年轻的艺术家刘炜，他也向年轻的教师，录像艺术家张培力和吴山专学习，同时还同唐宋和刘安平是朋友。但是，这其中最重要的还是他的个人老师梁全，他刚从旧金山艺术学院回国。

        Yan Lei: "Free Langfang"
        <p>Jonathan Napack</p>
      </h2>
      <p>
      Yan Lei was born in Langfang in 1965 to a company accountant and a school teacher. Several relatives were well-known painters. At the age of 14, when education was re-normalized, he moved to Baoding (in Hebei ) to attend the design school there.
      </p>
      <p>
      After finishing in Baoding, he spent several years trying to get into the China Art Academy in Hangzhou, succeeding in 1987. "I was basically a printmaker when I arrived. Just having access to their the library totally changed my perspective. Suddenly we had a way to know about what was happening in the rest of the world."
      </p>
      <p>
      The Hangzhou academy, then with Xiao Feng as dean, was an incubator for many who would later be recognized as major artists. Yan Lei roomed with artist/curator Qiu Zhijie, put up the very young Liu Wei in his studio, learned from new teachers like video artist Zhang Peili and Wu Shanzhuan, and formed what he calls "a little gang" with Tang Song and Lu Anping. Perhaps most important was his personal tutor, Liang Quan, who had just come back from the San Francisco Art Institute.

      “One Work" is an exhibition series that I am curating this year. The plan is to invite two or three artists at a time to create a piece of art together. "Taikang Project", the work which inaugurated the series, was created by Hong Hao and Yan Lei. This took place successfully in April of this year. The artwork is primarily composed of two parts: one part is a 3 x 5.9 meter painting; the other part consists of three life insurance policies with a total sum close to seven million yuan.
      </p>
      <p>
      This is a piece of conceptual art. Linguistically speaking, Hong Hao and Yang Lei have never adopted the reflexive subject-object methodology, but have adopted a visual methodology that emphasizes depth and multiplicity of meaning. They have chosen "Van Gogh" and "Taikang" as their two main creative elements.

        “绘画就是占领博物馆墙面的东西。”颜磊这样回答了关于“什么是绘画”的问题，在上个月初北京最近的艺术博览会同时举行的管艺收藏展中，管艺向十个参展艺
术家提出了这个问题。这一展览在隶属于丹麦文化中心的一家画廊空间举行，位于一片叫做
“上东”的高档公寓底层，离颜磊所居住的北京东北角相当近。一面显眼的墙面上挂着八张已成为颜磊标志之一的“彩轮”系列作品；每张一平方米的帆布画面排列
得当，有心的参观者可以一眼看出画面中靶心的颜色是如何成为下一副画的背景色的。这些绘画的理性逻辑——由未经训练的工人根据色板的序列直接用无需调色的
丙烯颜料来涂画——这和经常变换的展出背景表面上的任意性一样重要。这种作品与展示、艺术家与系统、创作者意图和话语系统之间的反差是颜磊现在生活与工作

        “Painting is a way of occupying space on museum walls.” Thus responded
Yan Lei to a question—“What is painting?”—posed by Guan Yi to the ten
artists participating in his collection show organized in conjunction
with Beijing’s newest art fair early last month. That exhibition was
staged in a nondescript gallery space belonging to the Danish Cultural
Council, located on the ground floor of an upscale apartment complex
called “Upper East Side,” down the street from where Yan Lei lives in
northeast Beijing. One prominent wall was indeed occupied by eight works
from the “Color Wheel” series that has become one of Yan Lei’s
trademarks; the one-meter square canvases were hung correctly so that
the discerning viewer could see how the color of the bull’s eye in one
painting became the color of the background in the next.

        Super-light – Yan Lei’s Art Practice
        <p>Ai Weiei</p>
      </h2>
      <p>
      Yan Lei has started on a new painting series since 2002. Judging from the very first work of this series, we could sense that this was the beginning of an inexhaustible subject in the same way as a drop of salty liquid is in relation to the sea. Yan Lei’s work continually explores and recounts the artist’s interpretation of the ultimate relationship among culture, the act of painting and expression.
      </p>
      <p>
      The technique and direction of this type of work have risen from the artist’s realization and understanding, when it comes to painting, as a two-dimensional medium of expression, of the unswerving relationship between the meaning of expression and its form, the indispensability of expression itself, its superficial nature, the relevance, characteristic and the finest state of the motivation for such expression, as well as the consistency between the artist’s world view as expressed and his life style. Such awareness has effortlessly lifted the artist from his personal experience in a narrow sense and the narcissistic complex usually born out of expression.

        颜磊的所有作品均诉诸图像。在其早期作品中(如表演、装置等)，摄影大多只作为其作品本身存在（或曾经存在）的记录证明。然而自1998年底，图像在颜磊的艺术创作中扮演起了更为重要的角色，它成为其近期创作——绘画的主体。在颜磊目前采用的复杂工艺中，摄影作用于作品成型之前而非之后；也就是说，摄影成了图画的来源。尽管两者的秩序颠倒，但图像仍企图作为现实的“纪实摄影”而保持其原有价值。在此有必要提及的是颜磊将现实称作“废弃物”，但其描绘的一切都来自其日常生活，这样做的原因按颜磊的话说，即：“人得有潜能、潜力、一个心理上的内在动因…这是个交换的时代…我的作品是我个人对外在世界的精神反应，我只能这么说，是生活需要。”

      <p>
      In all his works Yan Lei (*1965, Hebei, China, lives and works in Beijing) resorts to the support of images. In his past works (performances, installations and so forth) photographs served mostly as documents evidencing the existence (or the past existence) of the work of art itself. Since the end of 1998, however, pictures started to have a much greater relevance in Yan Leis artistic creation, becoming an essential constituent tool of a quite new trend that characterizes a substantial part of his recent production: the paintings. In the complex pictorial process Yan Lei now uses, the photograph no longer supports the work when the latter is already begun or completed, but even before it exists; namely, the photo now establishes the origin of a painting. Although the time order has changed, the image, intended as a photodocument of reality, keeps its value unaltered. It is important to point out that he regards reality as "rubbish", but all the subjects he depicts are drawn from his actual life and this because, as he states, "hey have a latent capacity, a potentiality, an innermost reason that has to do with psychology. (…) This is an age of interchanges…my works are my personal spiritual reaction to the external world, I can say only this, it is a need of life".

Talking about the relationship between actuality and his paintings, he explains: "The subjects of my works are highly personal. The reason for their existence in my art is due to the fact that they somehow influence my real life. When I see something that concerns me closely, it is right then that I make use of those images.

        Poised between attack and defense, detachment and complicity, sarcasm
and regard, Yan Lei’s is a “creativity of re-action.” Yan Lei has
recently shown an inclination toward works conceived ad hoc in response
to a given topic, but his past conceptual provocations concentrated
mainly on the power dynamics of the international art world, from a
strictly personal point of view. His videos, installations,
performances, and paintings reveal a sharp analysis of the real and
psychological phenomena, which at once link the artist’s inner space to
the outside world, and disengage from it. By subtly playing with the
exchange of roles, Yan Lei exerts an aesthetic tension that stresses
both the flimsiness and the strength of an existential membrane in which
the meaning of value turns out to be nothing but an artery flowing with
potentialities. Fully aware of being a player in this game, Yan Lei’s
works display the mise-en-scène of life, in which the continuous shift
between pretense and reality becomes the key to survival,
self-achievement, and eventual acceptance.

        In 1995, Yan Lei held his one-man installation exhibition Invasion.
Among the arts exhibited was 323cm,a works composed of photo, video and
material object. The photo was about a sow waiting for slaughter, on
whose right flank Yan painted out a 323cm white box. The video recorded
the whole course of the slaughtering and how the meatloaf in the 323cm
box was cut off. This piece of meat was kept in a glass bottle, as the
last part of the art.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the static photo to the acting
video, then back to the static object again, this symbol system revealed
the relations between life and death, legalized slaughter and public
exhibition, human being and animal, food and sample, foods source and
foods destination. But all these relations were questioned and
overturned by Yan. when a living animal falls into humans eyes, it is
